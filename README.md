# Perplexity GUI Clone

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ⚠️ Important Note

**This project is GUI/Frontend only - No backend has been connected.**

This is purely a user interface clone demonstrating the visual design and layout. All functionality is frontend-only for demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
